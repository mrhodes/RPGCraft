RPGCraft - Total RPG Experience:
[B]Version:[/B] v0.3.6

RPGCraft is going to be a full RPG experience for Minecraft.  The goals for this plugin
are to provide Classes, Professions, Leveling, etc.  Also, I will be adding NPCs and 
providing the option for server admins to make custom questlines, and rewards.

This is an ongoing project, and currently the most complete feature is the custom currency
that is based off of other popular MMOs and RP games.  Gold, Silver, and Copper.

Please read the following for some basic usage of the plugin, and if you have any
questions feel free to email me about the plugin.
