RPGCraft Readme

This is a full featured Role Playing plugin developed by myself for my
server, Tigerstudios.

Features implemented so far.
1. Coins drop off Mobs.  Still needs to be rewriten.  But works fine for now 
2. Able to select one of 4 Races (Halfling, Human, Dwarf, Elf)
3. Each race has Pros and Cons
4. Mining, and Farming are "fully" implemented
5. Enchanting is next in line (after some code cleanup and database re organization.

Please see our Wiki for more info

This plugin will require spoutcraft to work properly.  There is very little
that will work without it.  


As of now the needed config files ARE NOT included in this repository.  I will 
get these added shortly as I continue to work on organizing the code and database.

If anyone is interested in this plugin and would like to help with testing
please contact me at tigerstudios.mcr2@gmail.com
