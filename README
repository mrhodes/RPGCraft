This is a full featured Role Playing plugin developed by myself for my
server, Tigerstudios.

The main focus of this plugin at this point is to have a fully working
currency system with coins that drop of Monsters and a very different and
detailed combat / leveling system.

The other feature being worked on is a race system that includes: 
  1: Humans
  2: Halflings
  3: Elves
  4: Dwarfs
  
Each race will have different abilities and will all rely on each other
to successfully live in the world.

At this point in time the plugin is under heavy development in conjuntion
with the Grand opening of my server to the general public.  

A lot of work is currently being done on the database code and internal
organization of each structure.  As of now the code will compile and coins
will drop off monsters.  However the commands will throw errors and as such
should not be used.  I am currently adding in a multicharacter system and
this is why the commands regarding money are broken.

If anyone is interested in this plugin and would like to help with testing
please contact me at tigerstudios.mcr2@gmail.com

This plugin requires SpoutPlugin and PermissionsEx
