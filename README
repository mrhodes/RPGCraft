RPGCraft Readme

This is a full featured Role Playing plugin being developed by myself for my server, Tigerstudios

This plugin will most likely need some editing before you could get it working on your server
Unfortunately over time this plugin has gotten mixed in with my server and is now specific to
my server.

I am working on improving this plugin and making it a professional plugin that can be used
on other servers.

As of this time the only realy feature is the Coin and Currency system.

If anyone actually reads this and would like to know more please contact me at
